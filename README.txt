The files 
prop1.m2
prop3.m2
prop4.m2
prop12.m2
exmp14.m2
verify the computational statements of "Rigid Multiview Varieties" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03257)

However in order to ensure that the code runs properly you need the file computerVision.m2.
The other files load functions from it. You need to make sure that M2's current directory points to the
folder in which computerVision.m2 lies.
You can few M2's current directory with the command currentDirectory(); .
